# RPM-Agent

Final project for Georgia Tech's Knowledge-Based Artificial Intelligence graduate course. The goal was to develop an artificial intelligence agent that could accurately solve 3x3 Raven's Progressive Matrix problems (see below) using only visual data. Two methods were used for pattern recognition. The first was an extension of the method seen in *Using Human Computation to Acquire Novel Methods for Addressing Visual Analogy Problems on Intelligence Tests* (Joyner et al 2015), where images were compared using dark pixel ratios (DPR) and intersection pixel ratios (IPR). The second method was to compare images using horizontal and vertical intersection transformations. The resulting agent was able to correctly answer 9x9 RPM problems with an accuracy of 83%.

The Final Report describes the process in greater detail and the code for the final iteration of the agent can be found in Agent_Final.py. Supplemental and supporting documents, including iterations of the agent and the RPM problems used to test it, can be found in the Project-Code-Python folder.
